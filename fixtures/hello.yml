# - question: "I'm on the early access VIP list and received an email, but I see an N/A for Attendee tickets. What do I need to do?"
#   answer: "Whoops! The email you received included a Promo Code, which you can add at the very bottom of the sales widget. Enter <em>that</em>, and it will expose your secret VIP ticket."
- question: "Can my significant other join for Monday activities?"
  answer: "Absolutely! They'll need their own tickets, but you're welcome to buy one for them. Should there be a conference afterparty, we'll also make SO tickets available to that."
- question: "I'm a nursing mom; can you make accomodations for my needs?"
  answer: "We can indeed! Please reach out to let us know if you'll be attending and needing a Mother's Room or bringing your baby (or both!). We can make a private Mother's Room available and would love to hear about how else we can help.<br>Nursing babies are welcome. Please be considerate of your fellow attendees and step out of session rooms when the baby is noisy (it happens :p). We're also happy to set up reserved seating for you, so <em>should</em> you need to step out, your seat will be waiting for you when you return."
- question: "Can you accommodate my need for special meals?"
  answer: "We'll certainly try! You'll be asked about dietary needs on your registration form. Please be specific about your needs, and preferences vs allergies, as they require different accomodations and vendors."
- question: "Is Kosher food available in Portland?"
  answer: "For lunch at the conference, the venue will provide special kosher meals. If you'd like to explore other things, especially if you're considering staying in Portland for a few extra days, feel free to reach out for more info on local options.<br>It may require an Uber or two, but there's a Glatt Kosher takeout counter (with a full time mashgiach), a bakery, and a Cafe (Cholov Stam and Pareve), all in the Southwest. There's also a Jewish Community Center and Chabad chapter, both of which may be of assistance. They can also help track down a daily minyan if needed."
- question: "The training or activity I want to attend is sold out. What can I do?"
  answer: "Ack, sorry! On the bright side, we have small, intimate groups for activities and trainings. On the less bright side, that means they can sell out fast.<br>If the training you want is sold out, <a href='https://tilde.wufoo.com/forms/emberconf-2017-waitlist/'>add yourself to the corresponding waitlist here</a>. Should anyone be looking for a transfer, or a second group be opened up, we'll reach out."
